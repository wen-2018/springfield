# Data migration renaming ImpactDashBlock's locked_summary to locked_content, so
# it pairs with locked_heading the way the rendered summary_heading/summary_content
# pair does. Without it the copy an editor already wrote would read as blank, as
# Wagtail falls back to the field default for a key the stored JSON does not have.
