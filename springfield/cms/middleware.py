       fallback locale, serve that content at the alias URL without redirecting.

    2. Accept-Language redirect: if no alias fallback is found, redirect to
       the best available locale based on the user's Accept-Language header,
       falling back to settings.LANGUAGE_CODE.

    Note: for alias locales where Wagtail itself cannot produce a correct
    response (no Locale DB record, or no live root page translation), the
    pre-wagtail-interception is handled by ``wagtail_serve_with_locale_fallback``
    in the URL router — not here.  This middleware only handles 404s that
    come back *after* the URL router has run.
